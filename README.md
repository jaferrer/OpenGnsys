# OpenGnsys

 The OpenGnsys Project (pronounced _Open Genesis_) brings together the combined efforts of several Spanish Public
 Universities to provide a number of free and open source tools for managing and deploying computers. These tools
 supply a complete, versatile and intuitive system that allows the arrangement, installation and deployment of
 different operating systems. 

OpenGnsys is based on a modular architecture separated into different service layers which allows its
implementation in several educational and organizational IT environments, both in a centralized or distributed way.
The main management of the system is carried out by means of a simple web interface which supports delegated
administration. OpenGnsys is also suitable for isolated environments, being able to work in network failure
conditions (offline mode).
